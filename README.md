## Description

#### When

This is a professional project I did while in **internship at SpirOps in 2014**. It was a 5 months internship. I spend the first 3 months doing research on my subject and constructing my ontology, and the last 2 developing this interface.  

#### What

The internship took place with the Romeo project SpireOps had with Aldebaran, to develop a home care robot. In this project, I had to take care of memorization part, and to do so, the knowledge representation.

After the representation was decided, I had to implement a **human-computer interface** to create, display, modified a knowledge database and preform inference on it.

#### How

This project was developed in **C++** using the **Qt 4** library.  I developed it using **QtCreator** IDE. The version control used was **mercurial**.

---

#### Note

As a professional project, I carefully commented the code and tried to make it modular. It’s a good example of how I document my code.
